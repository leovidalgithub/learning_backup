# Waypoints

Waypoints is the easiest way to trigger a function when you scroll to an element.

### Sticky Elements
The Sticky Elements shortcut is used to make an element "stick" to the top of the page once a user has scrolled past it.
### Infinite Scroll
The Infinite Scroll shortcut transforms a traditional "Next Page" navigation into an AJAX-powered infinite scrolling UI pattern.
### Inview
The Inview shortcut gives you callbacks for various states of an element entering and exiting the viewport or a defined context.
